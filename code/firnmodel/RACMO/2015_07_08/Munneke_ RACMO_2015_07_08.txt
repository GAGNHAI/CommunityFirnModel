Dear Michael,

Thank you for your data request. I have prepared the Greenland part of the requested data. These can be found at

http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~kuipe117/yoon/

Here, you will find a number of files:

- two SMB files, containing the surface mass balance (= snowfall + sublimation + snowdrift sublimation +/- erosion - melt) in mm water equivalent per day. The file contains daily cumulative values for the period 1958-2014. The grids are 11 x 11 grid points around Summit and DYE2. This corresponds to an area of roughly 120 x 120 km with Summit / DYE2 in the center.

- two t2m files, containing the daily mean near-surface air temperature modelled at 2 m above the surface, in Kelvin. Grids are equal to the SMB files. Note that I processed the near-surface air temperature. If you really want the surface temperature tskin (i.e. the temperature of the snow-air interface), please let me know and I can process these data as well. At Summit and DYE2, there is a significant difference between t2m and tskin because there is a semi-permanent temperature inversion in the lower boundary layer, causing a few K lower skin temperature. What you will need depends on the exact forcing of your own firn model.

- Two tar archives containing 23 vertical profiles of density and temperature each, for 1960-2014 at a temporal resolution of 28 days. The first time coordinate is 28 January 1960, the second is 25 Feb 1960, etc. In each file containing the vertical profiles, there is a depth coordinate in m, showing the depth of each layer. The layers are irregularly spaced, and you may want to interpolate to a regular grid. The 23 vertical profiles are from 23 locations in a square centered around Summit / DYE2. The vertical profiles are available in a chequered pattern, for every other grid point compared to the SMB and t2m data.

- Two txt files containing the corresponding lat and lon values for each profile. The profile has a number between 1 and 6972. The corresponding number can be found in the txt file from which you can retrieve the lat and lon value for each profile.

If you have any more questions, please let me know. Antarctic data will be provided by Stefan.
When you are finished downloading these data, let me know so I can delete the files from the web server and make room for other data requests.

With best regards,
Peter

By the way: details on the Greenland firn product can be found in the recently published manuscript at

The vertical layers are usually about 5 cm thick. For Greenland, the spatial resolution is 11 x 11 km. For Antarctica, it is 27 x 27 km.

However, the model that forms the basis of the firn products over Antarctica and Greenland does not use the positive degree day approach from that paper, but direct forcing of surface mass fluxes and temperature from the RACMO model.
